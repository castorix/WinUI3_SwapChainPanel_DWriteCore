# WinUI3_SwapChainPanel_DWriteCore

Test [DWriteCore](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/directwrite/dwritecore-overview)  (Windows App SDK 1.5.24 on Windows 10 22H2)

I noticed a loss of quality vs DWrite with IDWriteTextLayout when ID2D1Bitmap1 is created and drawn from IDWriteBitmapRenderTarget3; 
maybe I missed something...
